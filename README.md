# antigravity_first_look_at_tensor_logic
First try using Google Deepmind Antigravity to make a demo of Pedros Domingos' Tensor Logic

All .py files and the requirements.txt file in this repo were generated by Google Deepmind Antigravity based on the prompt:
```
Code a sample of Tensor Logic from the paper https://arxiv.org/html/2510.12269v3
```

Sample run:
```
% python demo_mlp.py 
=== Tensor Logic MLP Demo ===
Executing: Y[i] = sigmoid(W[i,j] * X[j])
Einsum: ij,j->i
Computed Y:
[0.58437969 0.68674208]

Input X: [ 0.5 -0.2  0.1]
Weights W:
 [[ 0.49671415 -0.1382643   0.64768854]
 [ 1.52302986 -0.23415337 -0.23413696]]
Output Y: [0.58437969 0.68674208]

Manual Verification: [0.58437969 0.68674208]
Verification Successful!
```
